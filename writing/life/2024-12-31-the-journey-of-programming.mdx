I tried to make the process of enjoying programming as objective as possible, so when the environment around me changed, least of the motivation of enjoying programming would've been deteriorated. When something uncomfortable appeared, I always told myself that I just wanted to do that and nothing else.

## The Initiative

I started programming on July 2021, at that time, I didn't know English very well, so that I wondered I could learn something using English, then I could gain the benefit of learning new thing and also familiarizing myself with English slightly more.

Programming was the choice, because I thought it's really easy, because I didn't need to change my physical location very often, it's just me and the computer, but also because it's full of English.

I first picked up _Head First HTML and CSS_, _Head First JavaScript Programming_, and some others to lay the foundation, after reading through them, I went to online course, I met Brad Traversy, Angela Yu, Jonas Schedtmann, and more, with most of the time spending on searching for English word, reading its definition, and understanding them, undoubtedly, my English went well.

## The Continuation

After finishing HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and more, framework came, then I started to learn them too. After getting into one rabbit hole and another, I went tiresome, so I went to Python, dabbling with Django, FastAPI, and some others, after that, I came back, then I decided to delve deep into the detail.

I finished reading the vast majority of the source code of TailwindCSS and Supabase, I planned on reading the source code of some other tools too, and also learning networking, which was the thing I finally realized it's the most intriguing thing for me. Probably, in the near future, I will use my own proxy service.

While doing all the thing, I noticed the job market not went very well, here was where objectiveness came in, I tried not to relate programming itself to anything subjective. With that in mind, I will keep enjoying it, and find my way to make it more attractive.
